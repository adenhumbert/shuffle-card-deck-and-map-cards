Standard video poker machines perform a continual "shuffle" on the card deck. 

This is optional in the following tutorial by setting "shuffling" to true/false in obj_deck. 

Overall, this should show you how to create a deck of card objects and shuffle them, then map the correct value to the objects you create in the gamespace.
